# Figma Connection Persistence Fix

## Issue

The Figma connection was being lost when users closed the Figma Integration Modal (by clicking the X close button). This caused users to have to re-authenticate every time they reopened the modal, even though the session data was stored in localStorage.

## Root Cause

The modal's close handler was directly calling `onClose()` without any logic to preserve the connection state. While the localStorage session data remained intact, there was no explicit mechanism to:

1. Extend the session when closing the modal
2. Document that the session should persist across modal open/close cycles
3. Distinguish between "closing the modal" vs "disconnecting from Figma"

## Solution

Implemented a dedicated `handleClose` callback that:

1. **Preserves the session** - Does NOT clear any Figma authentication data
2. **Extends the session** - Automatically extends the trusted session by 7 days when closing the modal while connected
3. **Logs behavior** - Adds clear console logs to track session preservation
4. **Separates concerns** - Distinguishes between modal close (X button) and explicit disconnect (Disconnect button)

### Code Changes

#### 1. Added `handleClose` Handler

```typescript
const handleClose = useCallback(() => {
  // IMPORTANT: Do NOT clear the Figma session when closing the modal
  // The session should persist so users stay connected across modal open/close cycles
  // Only the explicit "Disconnect" button should clear the session
  console.log("ðŸšª Closing Figma modal - preserving connection state");

  // Extend the session on close to maintain connectivity
  if (isConnected) {
    extendTrustedSession();
    console.log("ðŸ”„ Extended Figma session on modal close");
  }

  onClose();
}, [isConnected, onClose]);
```

#### 2. Updated Close Button

Changed from:

```typescript
<button className="figma-modal-close" onClick={onClose} ...>
```

To:

```typescript
<button className="figma-modal-close" onClick={handleClose} ...>
```

#### 3. Added Documentation Comment

Added clear comments to the `useEffect` hook that handles modal opening to document the intended behavior:

```typescript
// IMPORTANT: When modal closes, DO NOT clear the connection
// The session should persist across modal open/close cycles
// Only clear session when user explicitly clicks "Disconnect"
```

## Behavior After Fix

### When User Closes Modal (X Button)

âœ… Figma connection remains active
âœ… Session is extended by 7 more days
âœ… OAuth tokens remain in localStorage
âœ… Next time modal opens, user is still connected
âœ… Can immediately import designs without re-authenticating

### When User Clicks Disconnect Button

âœ… Connection is properly cleared
âœ… OAuth tokens are removed
âœ… Session data is cleared
âœ… User must re-authenticate to use Figma features

## Session Management

- **Session Duration**: 7 days (extended on each modal close)
- **Storage**: localStorage with keys:
  - `figma_oauth_session` - Trusted session metadata
  - `figma_oauth_tokens` - OAuth access tokens
  - `figma_oauth_timestamp` - Token creation time
- **Auto-Extension**: Session is extended when:
  - Modal is opened while connected
  - Modal is closed while connected
  - Session data is accessed

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Connect to Figma using OAuth or manual token
2. Import a design successfully
3. Close the modal (X button)
4. Reopen the modal
5. âœ… Should show "Connected to Figma" status
6. âœ… Should allow immediate design import
7. âœ… No re-authentication required

## Files Modified

- `/src/components/FigmaIntegrationModal.tsx`
  - Added `handleClose` callback
  - Updated close button handler
  - Added documentation comments

## Related Code

- Session management: `readTrustedSession()`, `persistTrustedSession()`, `extendTrustedSession()`
- Disconnect handler: `handleDisconnect()` - Still properly clears session when needed
- OAuth flow: Unaffected, continues to work as expected
