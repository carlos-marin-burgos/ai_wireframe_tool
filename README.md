# Designetica Wireframe Generator

A professional wireframing tool using Microsoft Atlas Design system for creating high-quality UI mockups and wireframes.

## Features

- Microsoft Atlas Design integration
- Complete form component library
- Multiple layout templates
- Professional styling and input controls
- Azure Functions backend

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   func start
   ```

3. Start the frontend:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Notes

⚠️ **Important**: If changes aren't reflecting in the browser, run:
```
npm run dev:clean
```

This ensures `index.html` points to development files (`/src/main.tsx`) instead of built assets.
