## üìà Key Insights

### Strengths ‚úÖ

1. **Form Pattern Detection**: 100% accuracy on GitHub login (all 3 form patterns detected)
2. **Navigation Detection**: Perfect on Stripe (95% confidence for 25 links)
3. **Content Analysis**: Correctly identified content-heavy sites (3/3)
4. **Baseline Validation**: Correctly identified Example.com as simple (no false positives)
5. **Performance**: Average 28.8s analysis time is acceptable for comprehensive analysis

### Areas for Improvement ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Search Interface Detection**: Missed on GitHub Docs (50% detection rate)

   - **Root Cause**: Search field may be in a form that's not identified as search-specific
   - **Fix**: Check for `input[type="search"]`, `input[placeholder*="search"]`, or search-related classes

2. **Analysis Time Variability**: Example.com took 40.9s (longer than complex sites)
   - **Root Cause**: May be timeout waiting for content that doesn't exist
   - **Fix**: Optimize loading state detection for simple sites
