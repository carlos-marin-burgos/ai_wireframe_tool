# 🎯 Figma Library Modal & Dev Playbooks Status Summary

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### What You Should See Now:

#### 📍 **Page Navigation Toolbar (Pages Bar)**

Two new buttons have been added to the Pages toolbar:

1. **📚 Dev Playbooks Button** (FiCode icon)

   - Tooltip: "Dev Playbooks"
   - Opens: Dev Playbooks Library Modal
   - Contains: Fluent Dev, Atlas Dev, Azure Communication Services

2. **🎨 Figma Components Button** (FiLayers icon)

   - Tooltip: "Figma Components"
   - Opens: Figma Components Library Modal
   - Contains: Fluent Figma, Atlas Figma, Azure Figma

3. **📦 Component Library (Legacy)** (FiGrid icon)
   - Tooltip: "Component Library (Legacy)"
   - Opens: Original combined library (for backward compatibility)

#### 🔧 **Fixed Issues:**

- **Library Type Filtering**: Added proper filtering by `libraryType` in EnhancedComponentLibrary
- **Source Counts**: Now only shows sources relevant to the current library type
- **Categories**: Now only shows categories from components in the current library
- **Component Separation**: Dev and Figma components are properly separated

#### 📱 **App Status:**

- ✅ **Frontend**: Running at http://localhost:5173
- ✅ **Backend**: Running at http://localhost:7072
- ✅ **Build**: Successful compilation
- ✅ **TypeScript**: No type errors

### 🎮 **How to Test:**

1. **Navigate to the App**: Go to http://localhost:5173
2. **Create or Open a Wireframe**: Generate any wireframe to access the Pages toolbar
3. **Click Dev Playbooks Button**: Should open modal with development components
4. **Click Figma Components Button**: Should open modal with Figma design components
5. **Verify Component Separation**: Each modal should show only relevant components

### 📋 **Component Counts by Library:**

#### Dev Playbooks Library:

- **Fluent Dev**: ~50 development components
- **Atlas Dev**: ~30 Atlas components
- **Azure Communication Services**: 6 new components (CallComposite, ChatComposite, VideoGallery, MessageThread, ControlBar, ParticipantItem)

#### Figma Components Library:

- **Fluent Figma**: Design system components from Figma
- **Atlas Figma**: Atlas design components from Figma
- **Azure Figma**: Azure design components from Figma

### 🐛 **If Modals Don't Appear:**

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify Button Clicks**: Make sure buttons are clickable and triggering handlers
3. **Check Component State**: Verify `isDevPlaybooksOpen` and `isFigmaComponentsOpen` states
4. **Check CSS**: Ensure modal CSS is not hiding the modals
5. **Refresh Page**: Sometimes a hard refresh helps after code changes

### 📁 **Key Files Modified:**

- ✅ `PageNavigation.tsx` - Added two new toolbar buttons
- ✅ `SplitLayout.tsx` - Added modal state management and handlers
- ✅ `EnhancedComponentLibrary.tsx` - Added proper library type filtering
- ✅ `DevPlaybooksLibrary.tsx` - Wrapper for dev components
- ✅ `FigmaComponentsLibrary.tsx` - Wrapper for Figma components
- ✅ `App.tsx` - Added new prop refs for toolbar buttons

### 🎯 **Expected User Experience:**

1. User clicks "📚 Dev Playbooks" → Opens modal with development resources
2. User clicks "🎨 Figma Components" → Opens modal with design resources
3. Each modal shows only relevant components for that use case
4. Clean separation between development and design workflows

**The dual modal system is now fully implemented and should be working! 🚀**
