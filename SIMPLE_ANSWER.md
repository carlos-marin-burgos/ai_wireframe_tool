# 🎯 Simple Answer: Will Your Fix Work in Production?

## The Question

"If I make a change and see it work in localhost, will it work the same after I deploy to production?"

## The Answer

**Usually YES, but not always.** Here's the simple truth:

---

## 🟢 What's the SAME

- Your code logic
- Your React components
- Your UI behavior
- Your fix (session preservation)

## 🔴 What's DIFFERENT

1. **Domain changes** = New localStorage

   - Localhost session ≠ Production session
   - **Users must reconnect Figma after you deploy**

2. **Backend can be "asleep"**
   - First API call after 20 minutes might be slow (5-30 seconds)
   - Your code already handles this with timeouts ✅

---

## ✅ Your Figma Fix: Will It Work?

**YES, it should work!**

Your fix preserves the session when closing the modal. This works the same in localhost and production.

**One thing to check:**
Make sure your Figma OAuth app has both URLs allowed:

- `http://localhost:5173/api/figmaoauthcallback` ← localhost
- `https://delightful-pond-064d9a91e.1.azurestaticapps.net/api/figmaoauthcallback` ← production

Without both, OAuth won't work everywhere.

## 🧪 How to Test (Simple Version)

### Before deploying:

```bash
# Just run this one command:
./test-production-parity.sh
```

If it passes, you're good to deploy!

### After deploying:

1. Go to your production site
2. Connect to Figma
3. Close the modal
4. Reopen the modal
5. ✅ Should still be connected

## 🚀 When to Worry

You should test in production if your change involves:

- ❗ Authentication / OAuth
- ❗ localStorage / sessionStorage
- ❗ Long-running API calls
- ❗ File uploads

For regular UI changes, localhost testing is usually enough.

---

## 💡 Bottom Line

**Your Figma fix is good!** The session preservation logic works the same everywhere.

The only "gotcha" is that users on production have a separate localStorage, so they'll need to reconnect Figma after you deploy. That's normal and expected.

**Just deploy it and test once in production. You're overthinking this! 🚀**
