            <div class="overview">
                <p>Designetica is an AI-powered wireframe generator that transforms screenshots and images into clean,
                    semantic HTML code. This tool revolutionizes the design-to-development workflow by leveraging
                    OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision model to analyze visual interfaces and generate production-ready wireframes
                    with pixel-perfect accuracy.</p>

                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <h4>Imagine This...</h4>
                <p>Imagine you're a designer who just finished creating a beautiful interface mockup. Traditionally,
                    you'd hand it off to a developer who would spend hours recreating it in code, often losing design
                    details in translation.</p>
                <p>Now imagine you could simply upload that mockup and instantly get clean, semantic HTML that perfectly
                    matches your design—complete with proper spacing, exact colors, and responsive layout. That's what
                    Designetica does.</p>
                <p>Using advanced AI vision technology, Designetica analyzes your interface designs and generates
                    production-ready HTML code that preserves every visual detail. It's like having an expert developer
                    who never misses a pixel, working at the speed of light.</p>
                <p>So instead of the traditional design-to-development handoff taking days or weeks, Designetica makes
                    it happen in seconds. We've eliminated the gap between design and code, making the entire process
                    seamless and instant.</p>

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>The primary goal of Designetica is to eliminate the friction in the design-to-development workflow by
                    providing instant, accurate HTML generation from visual designs. This initiative aims to
                    revolutionize how designers and developers collaborate by removing the traditional barriers between
                    design and code.</p>
                <p>This project represents a significant advancement in design tooling, combining cutting-edge AI
                    technology with user-centric design principles to create a truly innovative and impactful solution.
                </p>
                <p>By leveraging AI vision technology, the project seeks to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accelerate Development:</strong> Reduce wireframe creation time from hours to seconds
                        while maintaining high quality and accuracy</li>
                    <li><strong>Improve Design Fidelity:</strong> Ensure pixel-perfect translation from design to code
                        with exact color matching and spacing preservation</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhance Collaboration:</strong> Bridge the gap between designers and developers by

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <h4>Primary users:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>UX/UI Designers:</strong> Looking to validate designs quickly and communicate with
                        developers more effectively</li>
                    <li><strong>Frontend Developers:</strong> Seeking to accelerate the initial markup phase and ensure
                        design accuracy</li>
                    <li><strong>Product Managers:</strong> Needing rapid prototyping capabilities for stakeholder
                        demonstrations and user testing</li>
                    <li><strong>Design Agencies:</strong> Requiring efficient workflows for client deliverables and
                        design system creation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I researched the biggest frustrations in design-to-development handoffs by talking to designers and
                    developers at various companies.</p>
                <h4>What People Told Me</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>"Translation takes forever"</strong> - Developers spend 2-4 hours recreating what
                        designers already made, often missing details</li>
                    <li><strong>"Colors never match"</strong> - Existing tools guess at colors instead of extracting
                        exact hex values from designs</li>
                    <li><strong>"Spacing is always off"</strong> - Manual coding introduces inconsistencies that break
                        the design system</li>
                    <li><strong>"We need real code"</strong> - Designers want HTML/CSS that actually works, not just
                        pretty pictures</li>
                    <li><strong>"Show me it works"</strong> - People need to see quality scores and accuracy metrics to
                        trust AI output</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>The Secret: Smart AI Instructions</h2>
                <p><strong>Teaching AI to "See" Like a Designer</strong></p>
                <p>The magic happens in how we talk to the AI. Instead of just saying "make HTML from this image," we
                    give it detailed instructions on exactly what to look for and how to analyze it—like teaching a
                    student to become an expert designer.</p>
                <div class="code-snippet">
                    <h4>Example: How We Guide the AI</h4>
                    <pre><code>Step 1: Find the Parts
- Look for headers, buttons, text blocks, images
- Identify what each element is and where it goes
- Measure sizes and positions precisely

Step 2: Understand the Layout  
- Find the spacing pattern (8px, 16px, 24px grids)
- See how elements align and relate to each other
- Detect responsive design patterns

Step 3: Extract the Style
- Grab exact colors from the image (no guessing!)
- Identify fonts, sizes, and visual effects
- Preserve shadows, borders, and other details</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>This step-by-step approach ensures the AI doesn't just guess—it systematically analyzes every visual
                    element to create accurate, production-ready code.</p>

                <h2>Concept Development</h2>
                <h4>Developed three initial approaches: drag-and-drop simplicity, Figma integration, and real-time
                    processing.</h4>
                <p>In the concept development phase, I explored multiple approaches to make AI-powered wireframe
                    generation accessible and efficient:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drag-and-Drop Simplicity:</strong> A clean, intuitive interface where users can simply
                        drop an image and get instant HTML</li>
                    <li><strong>Figma Integration:</strong> Direct plugin integration for seamless workflow within
                        existing design tools</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-time Processing:</strong> Live preview and editing capabilities with immediate
                        visual feedback</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After user testing and technical validation, the drag-and-drop approach was selected for its balance
                    of simplicity and power, allowing users to focus on their designs rather than learning new tools.

                <h2>Wireframing & Prototyping</h2>
                <p>The wireframing process was critical for defining the user experience of an AI-powered tool. Key
                    considerations included managing user expectations, providing clear feedback during AI processing,
                    and ensuring the interface remained simple despite complex underlying technology.</p>
                <p>I created detailed wireframes that addressed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Upload flow with drag-and-drop interaction patterns</li>

                    <li>Mobile responsiveness for various device types</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The prototyping phase involved extensive testing with real design files to validate the AI accuracy
                    and user experience flow. This iterative process was essential for refining both the interface and
                    the underlying AI prompts.</p>
