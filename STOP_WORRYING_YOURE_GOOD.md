## 💰 Cost Analysis

```
Your Current Setup (Azure OpenAI GPT-4o):
├─ Setup cost: $0 (already have Azure)
├─ Per wireframe: $0 (included in your Azure plan)
├─ Quality: 9/10 (Excellent)
└─ Speed: 3-5 seconds

Adding Claude:
├─ Setup cost: $0 (free trial)
├─ Per wireframe: ~$0.01-0.02
├─ Quality: 9.5/10 (Slightly better)
└─ Speed: 2-4 seconds

Is 0.5 point improvement worth $0.01-0.02 per wireframe? NO!
