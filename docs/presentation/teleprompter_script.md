## Script

**00:00**  
Imagine turning a plain description  
into a multi‑page wireframe  
in just minutes.  
Today I’ll show you how Designetica  
compresses early product ideation  
into a fast, adaptive loop.

**00:15**  
No tab hopping.  
No copy paste thrash.  
Just describe.  
Generate.  
Expand.  
Edit.  
Refine.

**00:28**  
Here’s what you’ll see.  
Initial generation.  
AI multi‑page expansion.  
Drag versus edit mode.  
Precise inline edits.  
Cross‑page switching.  
Miniature previews.  
Resilience features.

**00:46**  
Let’s begin with the first wireframe.

**00:50**  
[PAUSE FOR DEMO 1 – Generate initial wireframe (~45s)]  
(Resume after layout is visible.)

**01:35**  
You just saw the seed layout appear.  
Semantic structure.  
Readable hierarchy.  
Editable text regions.  
Zero manual scaffolding.

**01:48**  
Now we scale this into a concept set.  
Multiple pages.  
Each with its own content.

**01:57**  
Let’s add pages with AI scaffolding.

**02:00**  
[PAUSE FOR DEMO 2 – Add Pages Modal + AI generate (~60s)]  
(Resume after pages are created and first new page is active.)

**03:00**  
Each page keeps its own HTML.  
We detect new vs existing.  
We switch context cleanly.  
Previews are stored.  
Momentum stays intact.

**03:15**  
Next: structural manipulation.  
Drag mode versus edit mode.

**03:21**  
Watch how containers behave in drag mode.

**03:23**  
[PAUSE FOR DEMO 3 – Toggle Drag Mode + rearrange (~40s)]

**04:03**  
Drag mode isolates structure.  
Clear drop zones.  
No accidental text edits.  
Turn it off—  
we narrow focus to content.

**04:15**  
Precision matters.  
Only leaf text elements highlight.  
Parents don’t glow unnecessarily.

**04:25**  
Let’s edit some copy inline.

**04:28**  
[PAUSE FOR DEMO 4 – Inline edit heading, paragraph, button (~40s)]

**05:08**  
Edits persist instantly in page state.  
Enter confirms.  
Escape exits.  
No modal detours.  
No context loss.

**05:20**  
Let’s prove page persistence.  
We’ll switch between pages.

**05:24**  
[PAUSE FOR DEMO 5 – Switch between pages (~30s)]

**05:54**  
Edits remain.  
Structure remains.  
Ordering can later feed metadata,  
navigation mapping,  
or exports.

**06:05**  
Now the miniature previews.  
Compact visual recall inside the add pages modal.

**06:12**  
[PAUSE FOR DEMO 6 – Open modal, show mini previews (~30s)]

**06:42**  
These previews are sandboxed.  
Scaled down.  
Non‑interactive.  
Drag and edit chrome stripped.  
Pure recognition.

**06:55**  
Let's explore image analysis.  
Upload an existing design.  
Extract wireframe structure.

**07:02**  
[PAUSE FOR DEMO 7 – Image upload + analysis (~45s)]

**07:47**  
The AI reads layouts from screenshots.  
Identifies components.  
Generates editable wireframe structure.  
No manual reconstruction.

**08:00**  
Now Figma integration.  
Sync with your design system.

**08:05**  
[PAUSE FOR DEMO 8 – Figma sync/export (~40s)]

**08:45**  
Component library access.  
Reusable patterns.  
Design system consistency.

**08:52**  
[PAUSE FOR DEMO 9 – Component library selection (~30s)]

**09:22**  
Finally: sharing and presentation.  
Clean handoff modes.

**09:28**  
[PAUSE FOR DEMO 10 – Share/presentation mode (~35s)]

**10:03**  
Stakeholder‑friendly views.  
No edit chrome.  
Just clean wireframes for review.**10:15**  
Built‑in reliability features keep you safe.  
Automatic backups.  
Integrity checks.  
Safe recovery routines.

**10:25**  
Let's recap the complete workflow.

**10:27**  
Natural language to structured wireframe.  
AI multi‑page expansion with smart content.  
Distinct drag vs edit interaction modes.  
Smart element targeting and inline editing.  
Image analysis for existing design extraction.  
Figma sync for design system integration.  
Component library for reusable patterns.  
Clean sharing and presentation modes.  
Sandboxed miniature previews.  
Resilient backup and recovery mechanics.

**10:55**  
This transforms early design velocity.  
From concept to structured prototype—  
with handoff quality—  
in minutes, not hours.

**11:08**  
Whether you're exploring concepts,  
extracting from existing designs,  
or building with design systems—  
Designetica adapts to your workflow.

**11:20**  
Thanks for watching.  
Ready to compress your design iteration cycle?

## Presenter Tips

- One line = one breath.
- Leave ~1 second of silence before each demo pause and after resuming.
- Keep eye level steady; glide through line breaks.
- If you need to tighten runtime: remove lines marked with multi‑item enumerations first.
