# Formatting Toolbar Fix - Edit Mode Buttons Now Working

## Problem

When clicking on Edit Mode, the formatting toolbar (Bold, Italic, Underline, Remove Format) would appear, but clicking any of the style buttons did nothing.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by **focus loss** when clicking formatting buttons:

1. User clicks on text element → text becomes `contentEditable` and focused
2. User selects text to format
3. User clicks Bold/Italic/etc button
4. **Button click causes text element to lose focus**
5. **Selection is cleared when focus is lost**
6. Formatting command runs but has no selection to format → nothing happens

## Solution

Implemented a two-part fix:

### 1. Prevent Focus Loss in PageNavigation.tsx

Changed all formatting buttons from `onClick` to `onMouseDown` with `e.preventDefault()`:

```tsx
// BEFORE (didn't work)
<button
    className="toolbar-btn format-btn format-bold"
    onClick={onFormatBold}
>
    <strong>B</strong>
</button>

// AFTER (works!)
<button
    className="toolbar-btn format-btn format-bold"
    onMouseDown={(e) => {
        e.preventDefault(); // Prevent focus loss from the text element
        onFormatBold?.();
    }}
>
    <strong>B</strong>
</button>
```

**Why this works**: `onMouseDown` fires before focus changes, and `e.preventDefault()` prevents the button from stealing focus from the text element. The selection remains intact.

### 2. Improved Selection Handling in SplitLayout.tsx

Removed the problematic `setTimeout` approach and improved selection validation:

```tsx
// BEFORE: Used setTimeout and tried to restore focus
element.focus();
setTimeout(() => {
  const selection = window.getSelection();
  // ... formatting logic
}, 10);

// AFTER: Direct selection handling without focus manipulation
const selection = window.getSelection();
let range = selection.rangeCount > 0 ? selection.getRangeAt(0) : null;

// Validate selection is within our element
if (
  !range ||
  range.collapsed ||
  !element.contains(range.commonAncestorContainer)
) {
  // Select all content if no valid selection
  range = document.createRange();
  range.selectNodeContents(element);
  selection.removeAllRanges();
  selection.addRange(range);
}

// Apply formatting immediately
applyFormatting(range, "strong", selection);
```

**Key improvements**:

- No more `setTimeout` delay
- Validates selection is within the editing element
- Falls back to selecting all content if no valid selection
- Maintains focus on the text element after formatting

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/PageNavigation.tsx`

   - Updated all 4 formatting buttons to use `onMouseDown` with `preventDefault()`
   - Affected buttons: Bold, Italic, Underline, Remove Format

2. `/src/components/SplitLayout.tsx`
   - Refactored `handleFormatCommand` function
   - Removed `setTimeout` wrapper
   - Added selection validation logic
   - Improved error handling with console logging

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Generate or load a wireframe
2. Click the "Edit Mode" button (pencil icon) in the toolbar
3. Click on any text element (it should become editable with a blue outline)
4. Select some text or just focus the element
5. Click Bold, Italic, or Underline in the formatting toolbar
6. **Expected result**: Text formatting is applied immediately
7. Try clicking multiple times to toggle formatting on/off

## Technical Details

### Why `onMouseDown` instead of `onClick`?

Event order in browser:

1. `mousedown` - fires when mouse button is pressed
2. `focus` change - element that was clicked receives focus
3. `mouseup` - fires when mouse button is released
4. `click` - fires after mouseup

By using `onMouseDown` with `preventDefault()`, we intercept the click before the focus change happens, preserving the text selection.

### Browser Compatibility

- `onMouseDown` with `preventDefault()` is supported in all modern browsers
- `window.getSelection()` API is widely supported
- `Range` API works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Fallback to `document.execCommand()` for older browsers (though deprecated)

## Additional Notes

- The formatting buttons now properly preserve the selection
- If no text is selected, the entire element's content is formatted
- Multiple clicks toggle the formatting on/off
- Console logging added for debugging: "✅ Formatting applied: bold"
- Error handling includes fallback to `execCommand()` if modern approach fails

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:

- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+B, Ctrl+I, Ctrl+U)
- Visual feedback showing active formatting states
- Font size and color picker options
- Undo/redo functionality for formatting changes
