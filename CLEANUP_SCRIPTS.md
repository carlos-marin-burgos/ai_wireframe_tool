# üóëÔ∏è Cleanup: Removing Unnecessary Scripts

## What We're Deleting

These 42+ scripts were causing conflicts and confusion:

- Multiple startup scripts with different behaviors
- Auto-recovery scripts that interfere with each other
- Redundant monitoring and restart scripts
- Conflicting dev environment managers

## What We're Keeping

**ONE script:** `START.sh` - The only one you need!

## Why This Fixes Everything

1. **No More Conflicts** - Only one way to start = no confusion
2. **Predictable Behavior** - Always starts the same way
3. **Easy Debugging** - If something breaks, you know exactly what ran
4. **Simple** - One command: `./START.sh`

## Scripts Being Archived (moved to old-scripts/)

- complete-restart.sh
- start-consistent.sh
- smart-dev-start.sh
- dev-start-auto.sh
- dev-start-complete.sh
- fix-stuck-error.sh
- restart-functions.sh
- auto-recovery.sh
- dev-manager.sh
- safe-start.sh
- bulletproof-start.sh
- simple-start.sh
- And 30+ more...

## The Only Commands You Need Now

### Start everything:

```bash
./START.sh
```

### Stop everything:

```bash
lsof -ti:7071 | xargs kill
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill
```

That's it! No complexity, no confusion, just simple and reliable.
