# ðŸŽ‰ Auto-Recovery System Disabled

## Problem

Every time the app loaded, an annoying popup appeared saying:

- "Click to copy the smart startup command: ./smart-dev-start.sh"
- Or "./auto-recovery.sh fix-ai" alerts

## Root Cause

The auto-recovery system was starting automatically in TWO places:

1. **`src/main.tsx`** - Calling `autoStartBackendIfNeeded()` on app startup
2. **`src/config/api.ts`** - Auto-starting monitoring after 5 seconds

## What Was Fixed

### âœ… Disabled in `main.tsx` (lines 10, 22-197)

- Commented out the import: `// import { autoStartBackendIfNeeded, autoRecoverySystem } from "./config/api"`
- Commented out the entire 170+ line startup block
- Added simple console message: "Development mode - using manual START.sh"

### âœ… Disabled in `api.ts` (lines 1064-1073)

- Commented out the auto-start code that was running after 5 seconds
- Kept the `AutoRecoverySystem` class (in case needed later)
- Added explanation: "using simple START.sh script instead"

## Result

- âœ… No more popup notifications on page load
- âœ… Clean, simple development experience
- âœ… Backend managed by `./START.sh` script
- âœ… Vite proxy working perfectly
- âœ… Frontend and backend running smoothly

## How to Start Development

Just run:

```bash
./START.sh
```

That's it! No complex scripts, no auto-recovery, no annoying popups.

## If You Need the Auto-Recovery System Back

Uncomment the code blocks in:

- `src/main.tsx` (lines 10, 22-197)
- `src/config/api.ts` (lines 1067-1073)
